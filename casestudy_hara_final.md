### THE FATE OF FARMING
The agricultural industry helped humans to build communities,then villages, then cities, then empires and then led us to where we are now. It supports the global economy and a population of 7.4 billion. Somewhere between 68% and 80% of the world's food production comes from small and micro holder farms, the majority of which are in developing nations where money typically has a tough time making it to the farmers. We would starve without them and yet  we take for granted the food we eat often and not even think about where it's from. But we all enjoy food and hope to taste, relish as many varieties as possible from around the world. But in that plate of food lies the engine of the world’s food supply.

### NEW AGRICULTURAL REVOLUTION
Our planets and our civilization are changing faster than ever before but agriculture has not changed much.HARA is a global and open block chain based data exchange based in Jakarta founded by Regi Wahyu and Imron Zhuri in 2015.


>    "The problem in the agriculture and food sector are data related"  according to the Regi the founder of HARA
"  

HARA [^1] [^2] is an amazing tech company powered by the blockchain ecosystem from Jakarta, Indonesia which has come up with a solution to make farmers' lives better and livable rather than have to struggle to make ends meet. HARA means, from Sanskrit language, the soil nutritions and elements. With their tech, they connect rural, smallholder farms with banks and distributors of goods, like seeds, fertilizer and tools by simply sharing hard to obtain data that makes this possible with this system . 

The farmers live in villages and initially started in one village to streamline the process and now they have 117 villages,400 field agents, 10,000 farmers. This model has a scope of being adapted to any developing nation who has a big number of smallholder farmers. There are 570  million smallholder farmers around the world and they are in equatorial regions. Currently they are in Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Uganda, columbia
and Java

### A GLOBAL & TRANSPARENT BLOCKCHAIN-BASED DATA EXCHANGE FOR FARMERS

HARA has come up with a brilliant way to bridge the gap between money and small holder farmers, the bankers, credit lenders and others. The two worlds have rarely met before now.Before HARA arrived farmers usually borrowed money from loan sharks who demanded a very high interest rate. Regi felt that the farmers have to be more independent. 

In Indonesia the major documents for identification were on papers and that's hindering farmers from getting credit. By having them visible in the system, they can have access to a lot of facilities within the system like credit from financial institutions and insurance. And that's the reason they founded HARA. Good information is the basis for good credit and goodwill. In our current economy data is currency.

### COMPANY BACKGROUND

Through their experience in the big data enterprise called DATABOT, HARA is well positioned as they already have a wide and diverse network of data providers, data buyers, and value-added services. Their technological assets, custom-built solutions, network of clients and partners, community relationships and proactive engagement with NGOs/government bodies makes HARA a perfect complementary initiative for Dattabot.

### HARA REVENUE MODEL
The HARA business model is simple but the explanation of how they are accomplishing is complicated. In simple words they make money by selling data that are collected from farmers. The financial institutions, the insurance company and other vendors for agricultural supplies need to pay HARA to use the data. They also offer a platform to developers to build applications using their data for a price. 

### HARA ECOSYSTEM
The technology is based on a blockchain called Etherium for recording transactions and Cloud technology to store data. Every data put into HARA can be qualified by another person within the ecosystem. For example, a link is created when land is recorded,  if government documents are uploaded the rating becomes one, when the neighbors authenticate it the rating goes up, when a field agent confirms the rating is increased. A lot of people help in the ecosystem being a data qualifier. Block explorers a new supporting technology was created.
 Since it's a multi party transaction, it's automated by using blocks to get privacy, security and immutability. 

There are four stakeholders:

1. Data providers - farmers, database companies, satellite companies 
2. Data buyers - banks, insurance companies and retailers
3. Data qualifier - people who verify and validate the quality of data
4. Value added services - use data to provide valuable information to data buyers

>HARA collects any ID the farmers have to identify themselves and their family.The field agents help collect all the documents that relate to the land and do land tagging with simple GPS in the app. They explain the farmers why the data is being collected and its for the farmers welfare. Data about when the farmers plan to plant, what crop is cultivated, what fertilizer they use, How much is the yield and how much are they selling for.The farmers get loans immediately and also get incentivized by the point system whenever data is shared. The Points can be redeemed to purchase farm supplies and also for their daily needs.

>Financial institutions get verified data which is expensive for them and can save 37% of the cost of consumer acquisition by working with HARA.Also the loan repayment rate is significantly higher because the data is already authenticated.

>Field agents are trained volunteers who live in the villages who are incentivised from the revenue obtained by HARA who are encouraged to be data entrepreneurs. Each Field agent on an average collects data from 175 farmers.

>   Oraclize is a data carrier for decentralized apps. As data carrier, it provides a reliable connection between Web APIs and HARA’s App using enforced cryptographic proofs. It eliminates the need to open additional trust lines. 

### ROADMAP-ACHEIVEMENTS & FUTURE PLANS
 
It is inspiring to see more entrepreneurs using technology who look beyond profit, to the impact that they can have on people and the world around them. Reaching all of those farmers, their family, field agents, shopkeepers and the financial institutions is where the opportunity lies.HARA combines a strong technical knowledge and a passion for making a difference. When visionary thinkers understand their people, their problems and technology the potential for solutions becomes endless. It is just the type of thinking we need today.

HARA is looking into how blockchain can make the world a better place. As a blockchain for social impact project, one of the main reasons HARA uses blockchain is specifically to benefit the people on the bottom of the pyramid.Currently, they are already in the process of originating another 1,250 farmers with a total value of USD 154,000 and eventually will be able to gain access to fair banking services which they can afford to repay, have crop insurance against vulnerability such as floods or droughts, and have fairer negotiating a position with the off-takers that leads to a better price for their products.

In 2019 HARA collaborated with Aruna to bring data visibility of Indonesia’s fisheries sector.HARA with its decentralized technology through the blockchain will become a platform for fishermen to have access and connect with other stakeholders without any intermediaries such as banks, insurance, high quality feeds provider, and equal access to market.

HARA has collaborated with TerraSphere a Netherlands-based company that offers Geo-ICT (Geographic Information and Communication Technologies) solutions through satellite, UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) mapping, as well as GIS analysis.TerraSphere will add analytics services for satellite data and crop monitoring. This will bring valuable information to our stakeholders, for instance for insurance companies to automate their claim process.

HARA simply creates jobs for anyone with a phone.

You don’t need to bring any capital to join up, you just need to put in the work.In the current plan, HARA aims to attract people from rural communities to become Field Agents that will help the HARA platform prosper. Anyone in a village can become a HARA Field Agent, not just farmers themselves, and can eventually earn a salary of up to $700 dollars per month.

### RECOMENDATIONS
Not all problems can be solved with data. There are problems that are beyond our control like rain. In the future HARA should make use of its infrastucture to do groundwater mapping as its the majuor source of water around the world. HARA should facilitate groundwater sharing in places wheere there is actute shortage of water.
